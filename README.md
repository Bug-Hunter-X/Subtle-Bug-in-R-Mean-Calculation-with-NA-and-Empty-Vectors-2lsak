This repository contains an example of a common but subtle bug in R code related to calculating the mean of a numeric vector. The bug involves how the code handles vectors containing `NA` (Not Available) values and empty vectors.  The `bug.R` file demonstrates the incorrect implementation, while `bugSolution.R` shows the corrected version using robust R functions.  This is a useful illustration for understanding how to write more reliable R code when performing calculations with potentially incomplete data.
